If you know the ``decltype`` specifier from C++, then you probably know why I chose my website to have this weird name. You should be better spending your time watching something more important like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw">this dramatic chipmunk</a>.

That you are still reading means that you still want to know what ``decltype(me)`` means. ``decltype`` is a cool specifier for busy (a synonym for lazy) programmers introduced since C++11. It allows to infer the type of an entity or expression at compile time.

Sometimes, I run short of words to describe who am I or what I am trying to do in this world. So, to describe myself, I just chose to go with ``decltype(me)`` and sometimes ``decltypeme``.
